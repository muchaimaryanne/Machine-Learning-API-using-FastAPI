 Project Description
  <p align="center">
   
 <br />
   In this project, we aim to create an API that can be requested to interact with a ML model. This is an interesting solution when you want to keep your model architecture secret or to make your model available to users already having an API. By creating an API, and deploying it, your model can so that receive request using the internet protocol as presented by the illustration below.

Sepsis is an infection of the blood stream resulting in a cluster of symptoms such as drop in a blood pressure, increase in heart rate and fever.

The model that we will build will be able to determine the prescence or abscence of Sepsis.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Interface Screenshot][interface-screenshot]](assets/snip1.PNG) 

This project focuses on developing a regression model to predict the likelihood of a patient having sepsis. Sepsis, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by the body's response to an infection, requires prompt identification and treatment for better patient outcomes.

To accomplish this, we built a robust regression model using advanced machine learning techniques and a comprehensive dataset comprising various clinical features. The model was trained on historical patient data, enabling it to learn patterns and make accurate predictions regarding the presence of sepsis.

Additionally, we developed a powerful API using FastAPI, a modern web framework for building efficient and scalable web applications. The API allows seamless integration of our sepsis prediction model into any software system or application, providing real-time predictions based on patient data.
